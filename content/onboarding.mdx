# Congratulations & welcome to the Evolution X team! <img src="/reimu.gif" alt="sitefav" style={{ width: 40 }}/>

This page will walk you through the new device maintainer onboarding process!

<Callout type="info">
  References to "**us**" or "**we**" mean [Joey](https://github.com/joeyhuab) or
  [Anierin](https://github.com/AnierinBliss) in the
  [#maintainers](https://discord.com/channels/670512508871639041/830748686773387275)
  channel of the [Evolution X Discord server](https://discord.gg/evolution-x).
  The usage of `codename` should be replaced with your device's codename
  throughout this process.
</Callout>

## 1. Device repositories & initial installation images

Once you'll be accepted as an official maintainer, please provide us:

- Your [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.com) username
- Your [GitHub](https://github.com) username

Specify the repositories you need created or access to under the [Evolution X Devices GitHub organization](https://github.com/evolution-X-devices)

Once these repositories are created, and you have been granted access and pushed, please delete `lineage.dependencies` (if existing) and set up `evolution.dependencies` in each applicable repository for device source syncing via [roomservice](https://github.com/Evolution-XYZ/vendor_evolution/blob/udc/build/tools/roomservice.py).

Additionally, provide a list of image names required to be flashed in order to boot Evolution X recovery (initial installation images) coming from the stock ROM of your device. (E.g `boot`, `recovery` etc)

<Callout type="error">
  You **MAY NOT** substitute Evolution X recovery with **TWRP or any of its
  derivatives (OFOX/PBRP)**
</Callout>

**Example message using panther:**

```

### Roomservice chain

Here is an example of how to setup the roomservice chain (mentionned in [lunch guide](/lunch).)
We'll use Panther again as an example.

`device_google_panther` :

```json
[
  {
    "repository": "device_google_pantah",
    "target_path": "device/google/pantah"
  }
]
```

As previously said in [lunch guide](/lunch), we can see that Panther has only 1 dependency, which is Pantah.
Pantah contains the dependencies for building Pantah and Panther.

`device_google_pantah` :

```json

  {
    "repository": "device_google_gs201",
    "target_path": "device/google/gs201"
  },
  {
    "repository": "device/google/pantah-kernel",
    "target_path": "device/google/pantah-kernel",
    "remote": "aosp-pantah"
  }
]
```

But we can see that Pantah itself has a dependency, `device_google_gs201`, common to both devices.

`device_google_gs201` :

```json
[
  {
    "repository": "device_google_gs101",
    "target_path": "device/google/gs101"
  }
]
```

And again, this tree has an other dependencies:
`device_google_gs101` :

```json
[
  {
    "repository": "device_google_gs-common",
    "target_path": "device/google/gs-common"
  },
  {
    "repository": "packages_apps_PixelParts",
    "target_path": "packages/apps/PixelParts"
  }
]
```

<Callout type="success">
  Now you understand why this is called a roomservice **chain**. All the
  dependencies are +- linked.
</Callout>

## 2: Setting up the environment

<Callout type="info">
  This part assume you've read [Setting up the environment](/setting-up-env)
  before.
</Callout>

Since you are now an official maintainer, you have to make sure your builds are official too.

In order to set it up, you only have to

```bash
export EVO_BUILD_TYPE=Official
```

In order to set it up, you only have to
To make sure it's applied every time, you can add it at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export EVO_BUILD_TYPE=Official' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 3: Signed Releases

Maintainers are required to sign all releases with [our private keys](https://github.com/Evolution-XYZ/vendor_evolution-priv_keys).

<Callout type="info">
  Note that it has already been explained [here.](/setting-up-env)
</Callout>

There are no manual signing steps required.
Just clone the repository to `$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/vendor/evolution-priv/keys/` and compile.
Releases not signed by these keys will be removed from sourceforge without warning.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please keep these keys **CONFIDENTIAL**. Be cautious, especially if you're
  using a shared server!
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  **ANY INTENTIONAL OR ACCIDENTAL LEAK WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE REMOVAL FROM THE
  PROJECT, AND YOU WON'T BE ALLOWED BACK.**
</Callout>

## 4: Upload to SourceForge

Maintainers are responsible for uploading **releases** and **initial installation images** to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/evolution-x/files/).

### Example using Panther:

**`ROM` uploading** :

```bash
scp EvolutionX-14.0-20240724-panther-v9.2-Official.zip anierin@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/p/evolution-x/panther/14/
```

**`boot.img` uploading** :

```bash
scp EvolutionX-14.0-20240724-panther-v9.2-Official.zip anierin@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/p/evolution-x/panther/14/
```

**`dtbo.img` uploading** :

```bash
scp dtbo.img anierin@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/p/evolution-x/panther/14/dtbo/
```

**`vendor_kernel_boot.img` uploading** :

```bash
scp vendor_kernel_boot.img anierin@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/p/evolution-x/panther/14/vendor_kernel_boot/
```

**`vendor_boot.img` uploading** :

```bash
scp vendor_boot.img anierin@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/p/evolution-x/panther/14/vendor_boot/
```

<Callout type="info">
  All these commands assume you already have the corresponding folder created on
  sourceforge.
</Callout>

## 5: Create an XDA thread

Create an [XDA forums thread](https://xdaforums.com/all-forums-by-manufacturer) using the `$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/evolution/XDA/generate_xda_thread.sh` script found in the [XDA repository](https://github.com/Evolution-X/XDA).

```bash
croot && cd evolution/XDA/ && . generate_xda_thread.sh
```

_Please be aware that you will need to **manually** update the **installation instructions** to reflect the procedure **specific to your device**. The ability to automatically update these instructions during the generation script will be added in the **future**._

## 6: Add your device to OTA

Fork the [OTA](https://github.com/Evolution-X/OTA) repository and add your device using the json located at `$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/out/target/product/codename/codename.json`.
The contents must match that of the uploaded build! If the device is not currently in the OTA repository, your codename.json will look similar to the example below.

<Callout type="info">
  it is up to you to fill out the unpopulated fields and create a codename.txt
  changelog.
</Callout>

Subsequent jsons in `$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/out/target/product/codename/codename.json` will be fully populated using `$ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/evolution/OTA/codename.json` after your initial commit to OTA has been merged, allowing you to **directly copy/paste.**

<Callout type="warning">
  Please **respect the format** when making a PR for OTA ! Examples: **Adding**
  a device : `OTA: Add Google Pixel 7 (panther)` **Updating** single device:
  `Panther: 08/24/2024 Update` **Updating** multiple device:
  `Panther/Cheetah/Lynx: 08/24/2024 Update`
</Callout>

Example codename.json name using `panther` :

```json

  "response": [
    {

      "oem": "Google",

        "vendor_kernel_boot",
        "vendor_boot"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  If needed, **super_empty** image has to be put on top of the list !
</Callout>

Example :

```json
"initial_installation_images": [
        "super_empty",
        "recovery",
        "other image..."
      ]
```

When done, commit, push, and submit a pull request via **[comparing forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits#comparing-across-forks)** with the main OTA repository; we will review and merge it **at our earliest convenience.**

# I want Evolution X to support XY device

You want EvolutionX to support your favorite device, eh?
That's right, who doesn't want us to build for their device. However, this is not that easy as you think.

## Blind builds

<Callout type="info">
  A blind build is the fact of building for a device without having the device
  to test it.
</Callout>

We can't build for your device if **we do not have the said device.**
Blind building is not appropriate for officially maintained devices and therefore, we do not do it. In order for us to make proper builds for your device, we need to have the device.

Simple as that.

<Callout type="success">
  Be patient. If your device isn't currently maintained, maybe it'll be later if
  a maintainer manage to get it. You can look for an unofficial build too.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Please **DO NOT** ask us to build for a device. Unless you can buy it for a
  maintainer willing to do it. As said before, we **WILL NEVER** build for a
  device we don't own.
</Callout>

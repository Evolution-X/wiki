# Setting Up a Custom OTA Server for Evolution X Unofficial builds

This guide explains how to set up a custom OTA (Over-The-Air) server for your Evolution X build.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A storage server (e.g., Sourceforge, Cloudflare R2, etc.) for hosting your builds
- A properly configured Android build environment

<Steps>
## Create an overlay in your device tree

Inside your device tree, locate the overlay-evolution folders you created and inside of them create Updater directory with its subfolders (assuming you commited the EvolutionX init changes)

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/overlay-evolution/Updater/res/values/
```

In the values folder create the file strings.xml and insert the following lines where (user) is your GitHub username

```xml showLineNumbers filename="strings.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources xmlns:xliff="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2">
  <string name="updater_server_url" translatable="false">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/(user)/OTA/vic/builds/{device}.json</string>
  <string name="menu_changelog_url" translatable="false">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/(user)/OTA/vic/changelogs/<xliff:g id="device_name">%1$s</xliff:g>.txt</string>
</resources>
```

## Build and Setup Your OTA Repository

Build your ROM

- Create your Evolution X build using your Android build environment.

```bash
m evolution
```

- Ensure the build is successful and all required files are generated.
- Upload the Evolution X zip file and the needed .img files to install in the target device

Upload Files to Your OTA Repository

1. In your forked **OTA** repository, remove all the existing JSON and TXT files.
2. Locate and copy the JSON file(s) into the "builds" folder of your OTA repository.

```bash
cp out/target/product/(device)/(device).json /path/to/OTA/repo/builds/
```

4. Get yout Evolution X build download link and paste it in the JSON
5. Edit the JSON file as necessary to fill in all the remaining required fields for your OTA update.


Configure Changelogs
1. Inside the "changelogs" folder, create a new file named (device).txt where (device) is your device identifier.
2. Add the following content to the (device).txt file:

```txt showLineNumbers filename="(device).txt"
This is Android (Version) QPRx with (Month) (Year) security patches

Notes:
==============================
- LineageOS-based source. Signed build.
- Make sure to be on (device) firmware first.
- Clean flash is required if coming from March 2024 or older builds.
- Always dirty flash at your own risk. If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots.
- (Root advice)
- Play Integrity passes, RCS works (As of mm/dd/yyyy).
- Includes (brand) camera.

Device changes:
==============================
* (List all changes for your device, including modifications to the device kernel and vendor files.)

Notable ROM changes:
==============================
* (List all major changes made to the Evolution X project repositories.)
```

## Finalize and Commit

After updating your files, commit and push your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "(Device): Initial release" git push
```

<Callout type="info">
Test your OTA build on the target device before releasing to the public.
</Callout>

</Steps>

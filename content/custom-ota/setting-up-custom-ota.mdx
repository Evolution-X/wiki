# Setting Up a Custom OTA Server for Evolution X Unofficial builds

This guide explains how to set up a custom OTA (Over-The-Air) server for your Evolution X build.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A storage server (e.g., Sourceforge, Cloudflare R2, etc.) for hosting your builds
- A properly configured Android build environment

<Steps>
## Create an overlay in your device tree

Inside your device tree, locate the `overlay-evolution` folders you created and inside of them create `Updater` directory with its subfolders (assuming you commited the Evolution X init changes)

```bash
mkdir -p /${device}/${your_phone_codename}/overlay-evolution/Updater/res/values/
```

<Callout type="info">
  Remember to replace `/$device/${your_phone_codename}` with the actual path to
  your device tree.
</Callout>

In the values folder create the file strings.xml and insert the following lines where (user) is your GitHub username

```xml showLineNumbers filename="strings.xml" /(user)/ {3, 4}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources xmlns:xliff="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2">
  <string name="updater_server_url" translatable="false">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/(user)/OTA/vic/builds/{device}.json</string>
  <string name="menu_changelog_url" translatable="false">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/(user)/OTA/vic/changelogs/<xliff:g id="device_name">%1$s</xliff:g>.txt</string>
</resources>
```

## Build and Setup Your OTA Repository

**Build your ROM**

- Create your Evolution X build using your Android build environment.

```bash
m evolution
```

- Ensure the build is successful and all required files are generated.
- Upload the Evolution X zip file and the needed .img files to install in the target device

**Upload Files to Your OTA Repository**

1. In your forked **OTA** repository, remove all the existing JSON and TXT files.
2. Locate and copy the JSON file(s) into the "builds" folder of your OTA repository.

```bash
cp out/target/product/${device}/${device}.json /path/to/OTA/repo/builds/
```

4. Get your Evolution X build download link and paste it in the JSON
5. Edit the JSON file as necessary to fill in all the remaining required fields for your OTA update.

**Configure Changelogs**

1. Inside the `changelogs` folder, create a new file named `(device).txt` where `(device)` is your device identifier.
2. Add the following content to the `(device).txt` file:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="changelogs" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="(device).txt" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```txt showLineNumbers filename="${device}.txt"
This is Android ${version} QPRx with ${month} ${year} security patches

Notes:
==============================
- LineageOS-based source. Signed build.
- Make sure to be on ${device} firmware first.
- Clean flash is required if coming from March 2024 or older builds.
- Always dirty flash at your own risk. If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots.
- ${root advice}
- Play Integrity passes, RCS works (As of mm/dd/yyyy).
- Includes ${brand} camera.

Device changes:
==============================
* (List all changes for your device, including modifications to the device kernel and vendor files.)

Notable ROM changes:
==============================
* (List all major changes made to the Evolution X project repositories.)
```

## Finalize and Commit

After updating your files, commit and push your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash /(Device)/
git add . && git commit -m "(Device): Initial release" git push
```

<Callout type="info">
  Test your OTA build on the target device before releasing to the public.
</Callout>

</Steps>

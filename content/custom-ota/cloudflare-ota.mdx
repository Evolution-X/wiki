# Setting up Cloudflare R2 for Custom OTA Updates

This guide explains how to set up custom OTA updates for your Evolution X unofficial builds, using Cloudflare R2.

## Why Cloudflare R2?

Compared to SourceForge, Cloudflare R2 provides superior download speed across regions. This will help your users to download updates much faster.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that Cloudflare R2's free tier **only includes 10GB of storage
  each month** (and about 1 million web operations too, but you won't use that
  much anyway). This guide will only cover for setting up OTA for latest build;
  use SourceForge to actually store your previous builds if you want.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- An existing Cloudflare account.
  <Callout type="warning">
    This guide will assume you've already set up payment for your Cloudflare
    account (so you're able to use R2 Storage Bucket feature).
  </Callout>
- [rclone](https://rclone.org/), which is used to upload builds to R2.

## Steps

<Steps>
## ‚ûï Create an overlay in your device tree

<Cards.Card

  title="Setting up custom OTA: Create an overlay in your device tree"
  href="/custom-ota/setting-up-custom-ota#create-an-overlay-in-your-device-tree"
/>
{/* Same as **[Setting up custom OTA](/setting-up-custom-ota.mdx)**.

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/overlay-evolution/Updater/res/values/
```

## üè≠ Set up R2 bucket in Cloudflare

Visit [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and login to your account. From the top right of the Account Home page, click **Add** > **R2 storage bucket**.

![Creating a R2 Storage Bucket using Cloudflare Dashboard](/ota-cloudflare/1.png)

Next, type in your bucket name (usually your device codename). You can also set your bucket location.

![Setting up a R2 Storage Bucket using Cloudflare Dashboard](/ota-cloudflare/2.png)

Now that you've created your bucket, head to Settings tab and click **Allow Access** on the R2.dev subdomain section. This will activate your download URL.

<Callout type="info">
  You will need this URL again in the next steps, so paste it to somewhere
  convinient.
</Callout>

## üè≠ Set up rclone to manage R2 buckets

**Install rclone**: To install rclone, run the following command:

```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
````

After installing, head to R2 Object Storage overview page. Click **API** > **Manage API tokens**.

![R2 Object Storage interface with documentation tasks, buckets (bluejay, cheetah, dummy), object details, and setup options.](/ota-cloudflare/4.png)

In order to interact with R2 API, you will need to generate an API token. Click **Create API token**.

![R2 Object Storage interface showing "API Tokens" and a highlighted button labeled "Create API Token"](/ota-cloudflare/5.png)

On the **Create API token** page, do as follows:

- **Token name**: Type in your desired token name.
- **Permissions**: Set the token's permission to **Admin Read & Write**.
- **TTL** (**T**ime **T**o **L**ive): Set how long your token will expire.

When you're done, click **Create API token**.

![R2 Object Storage interface highlighting the correct options for token name, permissions, and TIL in a form to generate an API token](/ota-cloudflare/6.png)

<Callout type="warning">
  Now you've created your new API token; however, for security reasons, this
  page is only showed once. **DO NOT CLOSE THE TAB UNTIL YOU'VE DONE THE NEXT
  STEPS, or you'll have to start over again!**
</Callout>

![R2 Object Storage interface explaining that the API token was successfully created](/ota-cloudflare/7.png)

Head to terminal, type `rclone config` to start. Next, type `n` to create a new remote, then type in your remote name as desired.

![CLI prompt creating a new remote storage "R2".](/ota-cloudflare/8.png)

Storage: type `4` for **Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including (...), Cloudflare, (...) and others**.

![CLI storage provider list with selection option 4.](/ota-cloudflare/9.png)

provider: type `6` for **Cloudflare R2 Storage**.

![CLI S3 provider list with selection "6" (StackPath Object Storage).](/ota-cloudflare/10.png)

env_auth: type `1` to enter AWS credentials, then paste **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** from API Token page.

region: type `1` to let Cloudflare manages bucket region settings.

endpoint: paste **Use jurisdiction-specific endpoints for S3 clients** URL.

![CLI configuration for S3 access keys, region (auto), and endpoint (.r2.cloudflarestorage.com).](/ota-cloudflare/11.png)

Finally, check again your configurations, then enter your choices to confirm.

<Callout type="info">You can now safely close the API Token tab.</Callout>

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Build, upload builds and setup OTA repository

Same as **[Setting up custom OTA](/setting-up-custom-ota.mdx)**, but with extra rclone commands to upload your build.

Also, remember to modify `download` field in `(device).json` to include your download URL.

```bash
m evolution
```

```bash
cp out/target/product/(device)/(device).json /path/to/OTA_repo/builds/
rclone --min-size 0 delete r2:(bucket_name) # empty bucket to save storage, skip if you don't want to
rclone copy out/target/product/EvolutionX-...-(device)-...-Unofficial.zip r2:(bucket_name)
```

<Callout type="info">
  For (device).json: Download URL will be `https://pub-(...).r2.dev/EvolutionX-...-(device)-...-Unofficial.zip`.

Refer to [this json file from my builds for Pixel 6a (bluejay)](https://github.com/tvyiutnhisokewt/OTA_Evolution-X/blob/main/builds/bluejay.json):

This is Android (Version) QPRx with (Month) (Year) security patches

Notes:
==============================
- LineageOS-based source. Signed build.
- Make sure to be on (device) firmware first.
- Clean flash is required if coming from March 2024 or older builds.
- Always dirty flash at your own risk. If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots.
- (Root advice)
- Play Integrity passes, RCS works (As of mm/dd/yyyy).
- Includes (brand) camera.

Device changes:
==============================
* (List all changes for your device, including modifications to the device kernel and vendor files.)

Notable ROM changes:
==============================
* (List all major changes made to the Evolution X project repositories.)
```

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "(Device): Initial release" && git push
```

</Steps>

‚ú® Congrats! Now your users can use OTA to update their devices.

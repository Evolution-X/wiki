# Build flags.

## Disclaimer and Informations.

When you build, you will often need some specific flags, depending on the situation.

Here, we'll try to establish a **non exhaustive** list of what flags you can find.

It's an effort made by the community to try to gather the flags. If you find this section incomplete, or if you want to add some things to it, please send a message to Onelots on discord.

<Callout>
  A flag is often used in the `lineage_$device.mk` file in your device tree. A
  flag follows the form `FLAG := value`

## Flags list

| Flag itself                      | Default value |   Accepted value    |                                                                      What it's made for                                                                       |
| :------------------------------- | :-----------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `EVO_BUILD_TYPE`                 |  Unofficial   | Official/Unofficial |                                   Define if a build is official or unofficial. allowed as flag but prefer to use as export.                                   |
| `WITH_GMS`                       |     True      |     true/false      |                                        Define if the build has Google Apps or if it's a vanilla one. (Without google.)                                        |
| `TARGET_USES_MINI_GAPPS`         |     False     |     true/false      |                       It often happens that a device can't fit all the google apps. So we use this flag to use a smaller gapps package.                       |
| `TARGET_USES_PICO_GAPPS`         |     False     |     true/false      |                        Same as MINI_GAPPS, but this one is the smallest working one. Not recommended tho because doesn't have Velvet.                         |
| `BUILD_BCR`                      |     true      |     true/false      |                                                     Allows to build (or not) the app Basic Call Recorder                                                      |

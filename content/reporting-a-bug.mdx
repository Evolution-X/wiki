# Reporting a bug

Aaaaah, bugs. Yes, it is annoying. But how to fight against it ?

<Callout type="warning">
  99% of the time, **we are aware of the bugs.** Kindly check your XDA
  thread/telegram group before reporting it to your maintainer.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  **PLEASE AVOID SPAMMING.** It will only lead to your ban.
</Callout>

## I've found a bug ! What should I do ?

Here is a list of things you can do before rushing to talk with your maintainer on Discord, XDA...

- Check the **Q&A section** of the website.
- Check your device's group chat (XDA Thread, Discord server, telegram group or whatever)
- Check on internet if it's not a common issue with known fixes.
- Try to fix the issue by yourself.

## I've done what is said above, but no one reported it yet...

Okay, maybe your bug is unknown. You should report it to your maintainer obviously, but there is a way to do so !

<SuccessCallout>
  Maintainers need real **bugs report**, not just **complaints**.
</SuccessCallout>

If you want to please your maintainer, here is how you should make a bug report.

1. - You will need to write the description of the bug.
2. - Please include the procedure of reproducing of it.
3. - If possible, provide the error link.
4. - If you don't have an error link, provide an `adb logcat` and upload it on our [paste server](https://paste.evolution-x.org).

<Callout type="info">
  Tip: when an application crashes, you can get a **log link** ! Actually, the
  crash log will be sent to our server to make the bug report easier.
</Callout>

**How can I take a logcat?**

You can use ADB to record a logcat by using the command:

```bash
adb logcat -d
```

Alternatively you can use [syslog (outdated)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog&hl=en_US) or [LogFox](https://github.com/F0x1d/LogFox).

## Example bug report format

Bug description: `<write the description of the bug here>`
How to reproduce: `<write the method of reproducing the bug here>`
Logcat: `<upload your logcat to our`[paste server](https://paste.evolution-x.org) `and paste the link here>`
Screenshots: `<you can attach screenshots to the bug report>`

## Why do I need to keep the bug reporting rules?

It is **way easier** for the developer and for other users as well, to see your bug report organized and not just a complaint.
This way the developer will be able to implement a solution to the bug you found and other users won't re-report the bug.
